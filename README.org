~docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d~

* Description
Since this is just a test assignment the project is not ready for production use. Some decisions were made to simplify development/demonstration e.g.: docker volumes, docker port forwarding, disabled redis persistance etc.

** Python
Since one of the constraints was using Python 3.6 and [[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/community-support-for-python-36-is-ending-on-23-december-2021/][Community support for Python 3.6 ended on 23 December 2021]] some dependencies are not up-to-date to be compatible with Python 3.6

** Services
*** Redis
Task queue is implemented on top of Redis List data structure

*** Postgres
Shipment data is stored in PostgreSQL database

*** API
API can be used to read shipment data from the database

*** Producer
Producer periodically pushes scraping tasks to the task queue

*** Consumer
Consumer periodically pops a task from the task queue and executes it. In this case it scrapes shipment data based on number and saves it to the database
